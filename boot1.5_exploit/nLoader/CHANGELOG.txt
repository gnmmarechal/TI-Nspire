Stopped the CAS anti-cheat popup from appearing on CM CAS (However, CMs still are not officially supported, and don't work correctly on OS 3.9 and newer)
Added downgrade enabler (only in boot2, not OS)
Fixed progress bar (no "jumps" at the beginning and end)
Added support for updating the OS "normally" (if nLoader supports the new OS)
Added a message instead of a red screen when an unsupported OS is installed
Added support for running non-CAS OSes on CAS hardware

Enabled all display languages on the TI-Nspire CM-C and CX-C
Replaced buggy nMaker with my own web app
Added showing the nLoader version in the image header (for BtMg, etc)
